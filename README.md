## What it does
1. Displays vitals of patients in the ICUs so the doctor doesn't have to keep looking up while operating to check the vitals while also being able to see the patient and do his work without any disturbance.
2. If a doctor speaks something, all the nurses get the information spoken on their screen glasses as a summarised text full of key words.
3. Display memo before operation on doctor app.
4. Display summary of important things spoken throughout the operation.

## Its advantage
Thousands of lives are lost every year because of time wasted during surgeries. We believe every second counts and hence help save this time.

## Target audience
Surgeons, doctors and nurses.

## Industry reviews
We tried asking a few contacts who are acting surgeons for their take on our idea and we received a positive overall response. 

## Tech stack
1. Web Development (HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JQuery, JS, Python [Django]).
2. IoT and Physics.
3. Microsoft Azure.
4. Flutter.
5. Heroku.
6. GoNative.
